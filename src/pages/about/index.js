          While studying engineering, I came across the subject of data
          structures & algorithms and started exploring it, I also got an
          opportunity to teach over <strong>800+</strong> students who were
          preparing for placements.

          Recently I've been involved in studying <strong>system design</strong>{" "}
          of various highly scalable products & trying to understand the thought
          process which went on behind the scenes.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've also been studying about <strong>database internals</strong> and{" "}
          <span style={{ color: "red", fontWeight: 700 }}>tinkering</span> with
          open source DBs like redis, juno etc and trying to build my own.
